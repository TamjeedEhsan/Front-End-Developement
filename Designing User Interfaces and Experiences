MODULE 1: DESIGNING INTUITIVE FRONTENDS AND MOCKUP DESIGN PRINCIPLES


User-Centered Design (UCD)
- UCD prioritizes the needs, preferences, and behaviors of users during the design process.
- It aims to create intuitive and effective digital experiences by understanding users' goals and expectations.

User Interface (UI)
- UI refers to the visual and interactive elements that users engage with, such as buttons, menus, and layouts.
- Key components of UI include arrangement of elements, typography, menus, images, icons, and forms.

User Experience (UX)
- UX encompasses the overall experience users have when interacting with a product, including their needs and expectations.
- Core concepts of UX include usability (ease of use), adaptability (flexibility for different users), desirability (emotional connection), and iteration (continuous improvement based on feedback).

Differences Between UI and UX
- UI focuses on visual elements, while UX focuses on the overall user experience.
- UI aims for an attractive interface, whereas UX aims for meaningful and enjoyable interactions.
- UI deals with presentation, while UX considers the entire user journey.

Design Thinking Process
- The design thinking process consists of five stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
- Each stage aims to understand user needs, define challenges, generate ideas, create prototypes, and test solutions.

Wireframes and Prototypes
- Wireframes are low-fidelity visual representations that outline the structure, layout, and basic functionality of a user interface (UI).
- Prototypes are interactive models created during the design process to simulate and test functionality and user experience (UX).

Steps to Create a Wireframe and Prototype
- Begin by planning the content for the homepage, identifying key components like the logo, navigation menu, and call-to-action buttons.
- Design wireframes by sketching the layout and determining the placement of sections such as Featured Courses and Recent Updates.

Testing and Feedback
- Transition from wireframing to prototyping using tools like Figma to create interactive prototypes.
- Conduct usability testing and gather user feedback to refine the prototype, ensuring it meets user experience goals through an iterative process.

Discovery Stage
- Designers collaborate to identify what needs to be built and the problems the product will address.
- Approaches include field studies, user interviews, and stakeholder interviews to gather user insights.

Exploration Stage
- Various methods are employed to define the design scope and user needs.
- Key methods include persona building, task analysis, and journey mapping to understand user interactions and pain points.

Testing and Listening Stages
- In the testing stage, UX designers conduct usability, benchmark, and accessibility testing to ensure the product meets user needs.
- The listening stage involves collecting user feedback through surveys, analyzing log files, and conducting usability bug reviews to improve the product.
