MODULE 2: WEB INFRASTRUCTURE BASICS AND TERMINOLOGY 


Role and Evolution of Web Browsers
- Web browsers serve as gateways to the internet, allowing users to access websites, stream videos, and play games.
- The first popular browser, Mosaic, launched in 1993, introduced image display alongside text, enhancing the browsing experience.
- Notable browsers include Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera, each contributing unique features over time.

Browser Capabilities
- Browsers render web pages by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using rendering engines like Blink (Chrome) and Gecko (Firefox).
- They support plugins and extensions, enhancing functionality (e.g., ad blockers, password managers).
- Incognito or private browsing mode allows users to browse without saving history, though it doesn't guarantee complete anonymity.

Mobile vs. Desktop Browsers
- Mobile browsers are designed for smaller screens and touch navigation, prioritizing speed and battery efficiency.
- Desktop browsers offer a feature-rich interface for larger screens, supporting advanced tasks and multitasking.


When you want to visit a website, you type its name (like "example.com") into the address bar of your web browser. Your browser needs to find the website's address, which is a 
series of numbers called an IP address. To do this, it asks a special service called the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the website name into its IP address. 
The DNS helps your browser find the right IP address for the website you want to visit.
Once it has the IP address, the browser can connect to the website's server and request the information needed to display the page.

The process of how a browser sends an HTTP request involves several key steps:
1) User Action: The process begins when a user enters a URL or clicks a link in the browser.
2) Creating the Request: The browser prepares an HTTP request, which includes the method (usually "GET"), the URL, and headers with additional information.
3) Sending the Request: The browser sends the HTTP request to the server over the Internet using the appropriate protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).
4) Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes a status code, headers, and the requested content.
5) Rendering the Page: The browser receives the response and renders the web page for the user to view.


HTTP and HTTPS:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers. An HTTP request consists of a request line (method, URI, HTTP version),
headers (additional information), and an optional body (data sent with requests).

HTTP Responses
An HTTP response includes a status line (indicating success or error), response headers (providing information about the response), and a body (the actual content sent back).

Introduction to HTTPS
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, adding encryption to protect sensitive data during transmission. It ensures data confidentiality, verifies website authenticity through 
SSL/TLS certificates, and builds user trust with indicators like the padlock icon in the browser.

Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS:
1) HTTPS encrypts data, while HTTP does not, providing better security.
2) HTTPS verifies server identity, preventing connections to malicious sites.
3) HTTPS may have a slight performance impact due to encryption, but advancements have minimized this effect.

SSL/TLS Protocols and Certificates:
1) SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that secure communication over the internet.
2) Digital certificates verify website authenticity, with self-signed and CA-signed certificates being the two main types.

A web server is like a waiter in a restaurant. When you (the client) sit down and look at the menu (your web browser), you decide what you want to order (request a web page). 
The waiter (the web server) takes your order, goes to the kitchen (the server's storage), and brings back your food (the web page) to your table. The web server stores all 
the ingredients (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) needed to create the web pages and delivers them to you when you ask for them.


Web server functions
- A web server stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients upon request, using protocols like HTTP for communication.
- It acts as a repository for website files, ensuring secure data exchange through SSL/TLS encryption and managing multiple client connections.

Client-server model
- The client-server model operates on a request-response basis, where clients (like web browsers) request services, and servers respond with the requested information.
- Web servers play a central role in facilitating communication and managing client connections efficiently.

Server-side scripting and configuration
- Server-side scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python) enable web servers to generate dynamic content by processing requests and executing embedded code.
- Web server configuration involves setting parameters like port numbers, virtual hosting, and security measures to optimize performance and protect against attacks.

Load balancing
- Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple web servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, enhancing fault tolerance and service 
availability.


Website Importance
- Websites enable businesses to reach a global audience and operate 24/7, enhancing accessibility.
- A well-designed website builds credibility and utilizes marketing tools like SEO and analytics.

Website Anatomy
- Key components include the domain name, home page, navigation menu, content pages, visuals, and contact information.
- Understanding these elements is crucial for effective website design and user experience.

Types of Websites and Web Pages
