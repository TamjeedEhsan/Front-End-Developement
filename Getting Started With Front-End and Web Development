Key Principles of UI/UX Design
- Usability: Creating interfaces that are easy to understand and navigate.
- Visual Appeal: Using attractive colors and graphics to engage users.
- Consistency: Maintaining uniform design elements throughout the product.
- Accessibility: Ensuring designs are usable for all, including those with disabilities.

UI/UX Design Process
- Understanding user needs through research, defining user personas, and identifying goals.
- Creating wireframes and prototypes to visualize and test ideas.
- Conducting usability testing to gather feedback and improve the design.

Trends in UI/UX Design
- The field is evolving with trends like augmented reality, mobile-first design, and AI integration to enhance user experiences.

Prototyping and Collaborating Tools:
- ui/ux tools =  sketch, figma, invision
- Prototyping tools = axure rp, proto.io, marvel
- collaborating tools = zeplin, avocode, abstract

Design Considerations
- Responsive design is essential for accommodating various devices, especially mobile.
- Consistency in design elements, such as colors and typography, enhances usability and navigation.

Empathy and User-Centered Design
- Understanding user personas and conducting usability research are vital for creating effective designs.
- Accessibility should be prioritized to ensure inclusivity for all users.

MODULE 2: WEB INFRASTRUCTURE BASICS AND TERMINOLOGY 


Role and Evolution of Web Browsers
- Web browsers serve as gateways to the internet, allowing users to access websites, stream videos, and play games.
- The first popular browser, Mosaic, launched in 1993, introduced image display alongside text, enhancing the browsing experience.
- Notable browsers include Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera, each contributing unique features over time.

Browser Capabilities
- Browsers render web pages by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using rendering engines like Blink (Chrome) and Gecko (Firefox).
- They support plugins and extensions, enhancing functionality (e.g., ad blockers, password managers).
- Incognito or private browsing mode allows users to browse without saving history, though it doesn't guarantee complete anonymity.

Mobile vs. Desktop Browsers
- Mobile browsers are designed for smaller screens and touch navigation, prioritizing speed and battery efficiency.
- Desktop browsers offer a feature-rich interface for larger screens, supporting advanced tasks and multitasking.


When you want to visit a website, you type its name (like "example.com") into the address bar of your web browser. Your browser needs to find the website's address, which is a 
series of numbers called an IP address. To do this, it asks a special service called the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the website name into its IP address. 
The DNS helps your browser find the right IP address for the website you want to visit.
Once it has the IP address, the browser can connect to the website's server and request the information needed to display the page.

The process of how a browser sends an HTTP request involves several key steps:
1) User Action: The process begins when a user enters a URL or clicks a link in the browser.
2) Creating the Request: The browser prepares an HTTP request, which includes the method (usually "GET"), the URL, and headers with additional information.
3) Sending the Request: The browser sends the HTTP request to the server over the Internet using the appropriate protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).
4) Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes a status code, headers, and the requested content.
5) Rendering the Page: The browser receives the response and renders the web page for the user to view.


HTTP and HTTPS:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers. An HTTP request consists of a request line (method, URI, HTTP version),
headers (additional information), and an optional body (data sent with requests).

HTTP Responses
An HTTP response includes a status line (indicating success or error), response headers (providing information about the response), and a body (the actual content sent back).

Introduction to HTTPS
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, adding encryption to protect sensitive data during transmission. It ensures data confidentiality, verifies website authenticity through 
SSL/TLS certificates, and builds user trust with indicators like the padlock icon in the browser.

Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS:
1) HTTPS encrypts data, while HTTP does not, providing better security.
2) HTTPS verifies server identity, preventing connections to malicious sites.
3) HTTPS may have a slight performance impact due to encryption, but advancements have minimized this effect.

SSL/TLS Protocols and Certificates:
1) SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that secure communication over the internet.
2) Digital certificates verify website authenticity, with self-signed and CA-signed certificates being the two main types.
